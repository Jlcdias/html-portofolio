            internship , and i was also the first internshipper of the restaurant "50 Seconds by Martin Berasategui", in that restaurant we have 
            the possibility to get a lot of knowledge , as the sous chef of kitchen used to say sharing knowledge its what makes the world move
            foward. So i got the possibility to work with great and always fresh products, and that gives a lot of value to the food. And 
            also big bucktes to the supplier. These conditions made me to get "-Yuzu Lemon".
            During covid all the things in europe stoped, so i decided to work on the only thing that was having a lot of work that was pharmaceutical
            area, so i start as an intern admnistrative , in 3 weeks i was the rigth hand of the director and the owner of the pharmaceutical area .
